### How to restrict IP addresses that try to access a Ubuntu server CLI
There are a few ways to restrict IP addresses that try to access a Ubuntu server command line interface (CLI). Here are a few methods:

1. Firewall rules: You can use a firewall, such as ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) or iptables, to block specific IP addresses from accessing the server. You can use the following command to block an IP address:
```
ufw deny from IP_ADDRESS
```
or
```
iptables -A INPUT -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP
```
2. SSH configuration: You can edit the SSH configuration file, /etc/ssh/sshd_config, to allow or deny access to specific IP addresses. You can use the following options in the configuration file:
```
AllowUsers: Allows access to specific users from specific IP addresses.
AllowGroups: Allows access to specific groups from specific IP addresses.
DenyUsers: Denies access to specific users from specific IP addresses.
DenyGroups: Denies access to specific groups from specific IP addresses.
```
3. SSH key-based authentication: You can configure SSH to use key-based authentication, which allows you to restrict access to only users with a specific key. This can be more secure than using a password, and it also allows you to easily revoke access for a specific key if necessary.

4. Use VPN: You can use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service to restrict access to your server. It allows only authorized users to access your server via a VPN client that they have installed on their computer and authenticated.

It's important to keep in mind that these methods are not mutually exclusive, you can use them together for a more secure access control.

Please note that before making any changes to the firewall or SSH configuration, you should make a backup of the original configuration file, in case you need to revert your changes.


### How to restrict all IP addresses which try to access my ubuntu server except myself through CLI
There are a few ways to restrict all IP addresses from accessing your Ubuntu server command line interface (CLI) except yourself through the CLI. Here are a few methods:

1. Firewall rules: You can use a firewall, such as ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), to block all incoming traffic to your server by default, and then allow access for specific IP addresses. You can use the following commands to block all incoming traffic and allow your IP address:
```
ufw default deny incoming
ufw allow from YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
```
2. SSH configuration: You can edit the SSH configuration file, /etc/ssh/sshd_config, to deny access to all IP addresses by default, and then allow access for your IP address. You can use the following options in the configuration file:
```
DenyUsers: Denies access to all IP addresses
AllowUsers: Allows access to specific user from your IP address
```
3. SSH key-based authentication: You can configure SSH to use key-based authentication, which allows you to restrict access to only users with a specific key. This can be more secure than using a password, and it also allows you to easily revoke access for a specific key if necessary.

4. Use VPN: You can use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service to restrict access to your server. It allows only authorized users to access your server via a VPN client that they have installed on their computer and authenticated.

It's important to keep in mind that these methods are not mutually exclusive, you can use them together for a more secure access control.

Please note that before making any changes to the firewall or SSH configuration, you should make a backup of the original configuration file, in case you need to revert your changes.

Also, make sure to replace `"YOUR_IP_ADDRESS"` with your actual IP address.


### How to restrict all IP addresses which try to access my ubuntu server except multiple IP addresses that I have specified through CLI using iptables command
To restrict all IP addresses from accessing your Ubuntu server command line interface (CLI) except multiple IP addresses that you have specified through the CLI using iptables command, you can follow these steps:

1. Flush existing rules: Before creating new rules, you should flush existing rules in the iptables:
```
sudo iptables -F
```
2. Block all incoming traffic: By default, iptables allows all incoming traffic, so you need to block all incoming traffic first:
```
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
```
3. Allow loopback traffic: Allow all traffic on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) so you can access your server locally:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
```
4. Allow established connections: Allow all established connections:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```
5. Allow your IP addresses: Allow traffic from your specified IP addresses, you can repeat the following command for each IP address:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s IP_ADDRESS -j ACCEPT
```
6. Allow SSH traffic: Allow incoming SSH traffic to port 22:
```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```
7. Save the rules: Save the rules so they persist after a reboot:
```
sudo service iptables save
```
It's important to keep in mind that these commands are only a starting point for securing your server. you should regularly monitor your server and make adjustments as needed.

Also, make sure to replace "IP_ADDRESS" with your actual IP addresses that you want to allow.

Please note that before making any changes to the iptables, you should make a backup of the current rules, in case you need to revert your changes.
