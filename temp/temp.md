If a client fails to join a domain in Windows Server 2016 despite receiving an IP address from the DHCP server, it could be due to various reasons. Some common causes are:

    Incorrect DNS Server Configuration: DHCP can assign an IP address to a client machine, but it is not responsible for assigning DNS server information. Ensure that the DNS server information is being correctly distributed via DHCP or that the client's DNS server is manually configured.

    Time Synchronization: Time must be synchronized between the client machine and the domain controller. If the client's clock is ahead of the domain controller's clock, it could cause authentication failures. Windows makes it mandatory to have a maximum time difference of five minutes between the domain controller and client.

    Incorrect Domain Information: Verify whether the client is attempting to join the correct domain. Double-check to ensure that the domain name that the client is using to join the domain is accurate, including capitalization.

    DHCP Lease Time: Make sure that the lease time of the DHCP address assigned to the client is not expired.

    Domain Controller Issues: If the client machine is unable to communicate with the domain controller, it can fail to join the domain properly. Check the domain controller for issues such as low disk space, DNS Server error related to Active Directory, or network connectivity problems.

By fixing the issues mentioned above, addressing the DHCP issue, and trying again to join the domain, chances are high that the client will join the domain with no issues.
